                    The body is made up of trillions of living cells. Normal cells grow, divide to make new cells, and die in an orderly way. Cancer starts when cells start to grow out of control and instead of dying, continue to grow and form new, abnormal cells.
                    <br/>
                    Cells become cancer cells because of changes to their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). In a normal cell, when DNA is damaged the cell either repairs the damage or dies. In cancer cells, the damaged DNA is not repaired and the cell goes on making new cells that the body does not need.</div>

                    Though it is very difficult to pinpoint the definite cause. Certain substances, known as carcinogens, can definitely increase your chances of getting cancer. For instance, people who smoke or chew tobacco are more prone to mouth, throat and lung cancer, Contrary to popular opinion, beedi smoking is twice as dangerous as cigarettes. <br/>Continued irritation of tissues can lead to cancer. Pollution, preserved food, smoked and junk food are also contributory. Even certain viruses can cause cancer (EBV, Hepatitis B, HPV). Amongst other known causes are asbestos, arsenic, pitch, tar, ultra-violet rays.<br/>

It is better avoided. Take low fat, vegetarian diet. Avoid ill fitting dentures, report to doctor immediately if you notice any of seven warning signals. <hr />

                    There are seven common ones. They are often called the Seven Danger Signals of Cancer:
                    <br />
                    <ul>
                    <li>Change in bowel or bladder habits.</li>

                    By surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination of all these in the earliest possible stage of the disease. All these methods are available in India at various Hospitals. RGCI & RC provides all diagnostic and treatment facilities under one roof. The emphasis on cancer treatment should be on multimodal management.
                    <hr/>
                    <strong>Are radiation treatments good for all kinds of cancer?</strong><br></br>
                    No. Treatment depends on type and location of the growth. Some cancers will not respond to radiation treatment but must be treated by surgery or with hormones and chemotherapy.
                    <hr/>
                    <strong>How does Radiation act?</strong> <br/>
                    Radiation destroys dividing cells including cancer cells. Normal cells are also damaged. But now sophisticated machines are available which spare normal tissues and destroy cancer tissue with precision.

                        There are no fundamental differences in cancers in men and women. Most important thing is that common male cancers (lung and oral) are preventable because they are caused by tobacco. Female cancers (breast, cervix) can be detected early and cured.

                        <strong>What forms of cancer are more common among men than women?</strong><br />
                        Cancer of the mouth, throat, gullet, stomach, rectum, larynx, lung, skin and brain are all more common in men than in women. Gall bladder and thyroid cancers are more frequent in women.

                        No. The misconception that cancer is primarily a woman's disease is due to the frequency of cancer of the breast and cancer of the reproductive organs in women, in comparison with the more varied occurrence of cancer in men.
                        <hr />
                       <strong> Does cancer occur more frequently among married or unmarried women?</strong><br />
                        Reports from death certificates show that above the age of 40, the cancer death rate is higher among single women than among married women of the same ages. Single women have higher death rates from cancer of the breast and married women have more cancer of the cervix. Physicians believe that having the first child around the age of 20 is preventive against cancer of the breast. Multiple sexual partners increase the risk of cancer of the cervix.
                        <hr />
                        <strong>What precautions should be taken to avoid cancer of the breast?</strong>
                        <br></br>
                        Every woman above the age of 40 should have her breasts examined annually by a physician. Every women after the age of 35 years should be taught how to examine her own breasts (monthly after her periods). Screening mammography should be encouraged at the age of 40 years onward and then every 2 yearly. Soon we will have genetic markers to detect high risk group of women who are likely to develop breast cancer or ovarian cancer.

                        No age is free from cancer. Certain forms of cancer, especially of the eyes and blood are found in young children.<hr/>
                        <b>
                        If a parent dies of cancer are the children more likely to have the disease?</b> <br/>
                        The answer is no. In many families where a parent had cancer, the disease does not appear in the children. Again, a person whose family has no record of cancer may develop it. A tendency to develop breast cancer however runs in families. Even colon cancers are known to be familial.
                        <hr/> <b>
                        Does cancer develop more quickly in children than in older people?</b><br/>
                        The rate of growth at any age depends upon the type of cancer, though cancer does grow faster at younger ages.
                        <hr/> <b>
                        If detected in time, can cancer in a child be cured more quickly than in an adult?</b><br/>
                        The cure of cancer has little relationship with age. It depends upon the extent of growth at the time it is detected, the adequacy of the treatment given, as well as the type of cancer detected.</div>
